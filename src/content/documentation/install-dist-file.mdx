## Install using a dist file

If you are going to host Shlink yourself, you need to make sure your server fulfils its requirements:

* PHP 8.0 or 8.1
* The next PHP extensions: json, curl, pdo, intl, gd and gmp/bcmath.
    * apcu extension is recommended if you don't plan to use openswoole.
    * xml extension is required if you want to generate QR codes in svg format.
    * sockets and bcmath extensions are required if you want to integrate with a RabbitMQ instance.
* MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MicrosoftSQL or SQLite.
* The [openswoole](https://openswoole.com/) PHP extension (if you plan to serve Shlink with openswoole) or the web server of your choice with PHP integration (like Apache or Nginx).

### Installation steps

* Download the latest distributable file and decompress it at the location of your choice (you will find a pair of dist files for every supported PHP version, one for openswoole and one for non-openswoole contexts).
  <ul className="list-unstyled" style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: 0 }}>
    <li>
      <DownloadLatestBtn />
    </li>
  </ul>
* Create an empty database (not necessary if you are going to use SQLite).
* Recursively grant write permissions to the `data` directory.
* Set up and customize Shlink by either:
    * Running the `vendor/bin/shlink-installer install` script. It's an interactive tool that will guide you through the installation process.
    * Providing your configuration via [env vars](/documentation/environment-variables) (since v2.9.0). Useful to pre-define the configuration or if you don't have shell access to the server.
* Optionally, you can create a symlink to the `bin/cli` script in a folder which is in your path.<br />For example `/usr/local/bin` for linux systems. This will allow you to easily run shlink from anywhere in the command line.
* Configure your system to be able to serve Shlink:
    * [Serve Shlink using openswoole](/documentation/serve-with-swoole).
    * [Serve Shlink with a classic web server](/documentation/classic-web-server).
* Generate your first API key by running `bin/cli api-key:generate`. You will need the key in order to interact with shlink's API.
* Finally, access to https://app.shlink.io and configure your server to start creating short URLs.
