## Exposing Shlink through a reverse proxy

When you are serving Shlink with swoole or using the docker image (which uses swoole internally), you'll probably want to put a reverse proxy in front of it.

Swoole by default has some limitations that can be solved by using a reverse proxy:

* Using a standard HTTP port (80, 443), so that users don't have to explicitly set the port in the URL.
* Using an `https` certificate to encrypt the connection, keeping your users' data safe.

It is possible to achieve both just by tweaking swoole, but it is recommended to, instead, put a standard HTTP server in front of it, like nginx or apache, as swoole implements only a subset of the HTTP standard.

The only consideration to ensure all Shlink capabilities work as expected, is that you make sure the consumer's IP address, and the request's domain, are forwarded from the proxy to Shlink.

### Configure the proxy

Here you can find some docs on how to do it with the most used web servers:

* Nginx: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/
* Apache: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/en/howto/reverse_proxy.html
* Caddy: https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy

Example nginx configuration to use as a reverse proxy in front of swoole, with SSL enabled:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    server_name example.com another.com;
    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_read_timeout 90s;
    }
}
```
