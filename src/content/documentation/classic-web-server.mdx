## Serve Shlink with a classic web server

In order to be able to serve shlink, you need to put a web server with PHP integration in front of it.

Both Apache and Nginx are officially supported, but other web servers should work as well.

Here you can find two simple examples of the virtual hosts needed for both Apache and Nginx (you may need to modify them depending on your setup).

### Nginx

```nginx
server {
    server_name doma.in;
    listen 80;
    root /path/to/shlink/public;
    index index.php;
    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi.conf;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

### Apache

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName doma.in
    DocumentRoot "/path/to/shlink/public";

    <Directory "/path/to/shlink/public">
        Options FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
        AllowOverride all
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
