## Installation tool

Shlink provides a helper CLI installation tool which comes in handy to configure your instance when you are not using Shlink's docker image and you prefer not to use [environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables).

The tool is executed using the `vendor/bin/shlink-installer` script, and it provides a couple of commands that simplify installing/updating shlink instances, or editing some configuration options.

### Commands

In order to list all available commands from the installation tool, just run `vendor/bin/shlink-installer` with no arguments:

```
Usage:
  command [options] [arguments]

Options:
  -h, --help            Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command
  -q, --quiet           Do not output any message
  -V, --version         Display this application version
      --ansi|--no-ansi  Force (or disable --no-ansi) ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction  Do not ask any interactive question
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

Available commands:
  completion  Dump the shell completion script
  help        Display help for a command
  install     Guides you through the installation process, to get Shlink up and running.
  list        List commands
  set-option  Allows you to set new values for any config option.
  update      Helps you import Shlink's config from an older version to a new one.
```

### Main commands

The installation tool is designed to make a couple of main actions: install Shlink, update an existing instance or update the value from a particular config option.

#### Install

In order to install Shlink, run `vendor/bin/shlink-installer install`.

It will trigger an interactive tool that will guide you through the installation process, asking you questions about all the aspects in Shlink that can be customized.

```
Welcome to Shlink!!
This tool will guide you through the installation process.

DATABASE
========

Select database type [MySQL]:
 [0] MySQL
 [1] MariaDB
 [2] PostgreSQL
 [3] MicrosoftSQL
 [4] SQLite
>

[...]
```

At the end, it will generate a special config file which will later be consumed by Shlink.

#### Update

In order to update Shlink, run `vendor/bin/shlink-installer update`.

The update process is very similar to the "install" one, with the only difference that it will give you the opportunity to consume the config previously generated.

Thanks to that, the update tool will make sure to skip all "questions" for which it can already infer an answer from the previous config.

```
Welcome to Shlink!!
This tool will guide you through the installation process.

Do you want to import configuration from previous installation? (You will still be asked for any new config option that did not exist in previous shlink versions) (yes/no) [yes]:
> yes

Previous shlink installation path from which to import config:
>

[...]
```

Similarly to what the "install" command did, you will end up with a newly generated config file that containing what was firt imported, plus everything you provided for the new questions.

#### Set option

Sometimes you need to change some specific config option, but you don't want to reinstall Shlink completely.

Maybe the database password changed, maybe you want to change your default domain, or maybe you want to disable some tracking option.

In order to be able to do this, run `vendor/bin/shlink-installer set-option`.

It will display a list of all the possible options to customize, and you just have to select one and provide the new value.

```
What config option do you want to change:
 [1 ] Database > Name
 [2 ] Database > Host (or unix socket for PostgreSQL)
 [3 ] Database > Port
 [4 ] Database > User
 [5 ] Database > Password
 [...]
 [14] GeoLite2 license key
 [...]
 [20] Tracking > Disable tracking
 [21] Tracking > Disable IP address tracking
 [...]
 [28] QR codes > Default size
 [29] QR codes > Default margin
 [...]
```

> This command has a limitation. It can only be executed on a Shlink install where the `install` command has been successfully executed first.
