## Installation

There are three ways in which you can use Shlink web client. The [Free hosted](#free-hosted) one does not actually require installation.

### Free hosted

The easiest way to use shlink-web-client is by just going to https://app.shlink.io/.

The application runs 100% in the browser, so you can safely access any Shlink server from there.

The main benefit of this approach is that you will always have the latest version, and you will not have to worry about updates.

### Docker image

If you want to deploy shlink-web-client in a container-based infrastructure (kubernetes, docker swarm, etc), just pick the [shlinkio/shlink-web-client](https://hub.docker.com/r/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/) image.

It's a lightweight [nginx:alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/nginx/)-based image serving the static app on port 80.

### Self-hosted

If you want to self-host it yourself, get the [latest release](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/releases/latest) and download the distributable zip file attached to it (it will like something like this `shlink-web-client_X.X.X_dist.zip`).

The package contains static files only, so just put it in a folder and serve it with the web server of your choice.

**Considerations**:

These apply for both docker image and self-hosted approaches.

* Provided dist files and docker images are configured to be served from the root of your domain. If you need to serve shlink-web-client from a sub path, you will have to build it yourself by following [these steps](/documentation/shlink-web-client/serve-in-sub-path).
* The app has a client-side router that handles dynamic paths. Because of that, you need to configure your web server to fall-back to the `index.html` file when requested files do not exist.
    * If you use Apache, you are covered, since the project includes an `.htaccess` file which already does this.
    * If you use nginx, you can [see how it's done](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/blob/main/config/docker/nginx.conf) for the docker image and do the same.
