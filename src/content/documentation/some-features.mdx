## Some features

Here you'll find some extra Shlink features, which are not as evident, but you might still want to take advantage of.

This document also tries to clarify why some of these features work the way they do.

* [Short URL title](#short-url-title)
* [Query params forwarding](#query-params-forwarding)
* [Extra path forwarding](#extra-path-forwarding)
* [Multi-segment custom slugs](#multi-segment-custom-slugs)
* [Short URLs trailing slash](#short-urls-trailing-slash)
* [QR Codes](#qr-codes)
* [Bot detection](#bot-detection)
* [Email tracking](#email-tracking)

### Short URL title

Shlink v2.6.0 introduces the ability to optionally set a `title` for every short URL.

The title can be provided, but it's also possible to enable title auto-resolution. When that's enabled, and the title is not provided, Shlink will try to infer the title by calling the long URL and picking the value inside the `<title />` tag.

The title can be changed later on. If the long URL is changed, it will also try to auto-resolve the new title, unless the title was originally provided during creation.

### Query params forwarding

By default, Shlink automatically forwards to the long URL all query params originally sent to the short URL.

For example, if you have a `https://exam.ple/abc123` URL that points to `https://www.google.com`, when users visit `https://exam.ple/abc123?foo=bar`, they will get redirected to `https://www.google.com?foo=bar`.

If for any reason the long URL already had query params, they will be merged with the ones sent to the short URL. In case of conflict, the value sent with the short URL will take precedence over the original URL one.

For example, if `https://exam.ple/abc123` points to `https://www.google.com?foo=bar`, when users visit `https://exam.ple/abc123?foo=overwritten&another=param`, they will get redirected to `https://www.google.com?foo=overwritten&another=param`.

<Callout type="info">
  Starting with Shlink v2.9.0, this behavior can be overwritten on every individual short URL, allowing to disable the query params forwarding if desired.
</Callout>

### Extra path forwarding

Starting with Shlink 2.8.0, Shlink can match short URLs as soon as the visited URL starts with an existing short code.

When this happens, Shlink will append the rest of the path to the long URL before redirection.

For example, if you have a `https://exam.ple/abc123` URL that points to `https://www.twitter.com`, you can make Shlink capture visits to `https://exam.ple/abc123/shlinkio` and redirect to `https://www.twitter.com/shlinkio`.

When this happens, Shlink will track the visit as usual.

This behavior needs to be actively opted in, as it's disabled by default.

### Multi-segment custom slugs

Shlink 3.2.0 introduced the ability to create short URLs with multi-segment custom slugs.

That means that you can provide multiple parts separated by slashes as the custom slug, ending with something like `https://exam.ple/my/custom/campaign`.

This feature has some considerations though:

* When this is enabled, any URL will match a potential short URL. That means any future orphan visit will have either `base_url` or `invalid_short_url` types, but never `regular_404`.
* Because of previous point, this is considered a breaking change, and therefore, it's disabled by default, and you have to actively opt in.
* If [Extra path forwarding](#extra-path-forwarding) is also enabled, there's always a chance of conflict. If you have both `https://exam.ple/foo` and `https://exam.ple/foo/bar`, when the second one is visited, it will match the first one, and the `/bar` part will be forwarded to the long URL.

### Short URLs trailing slash

Starting with Shlink 3.3.0, you can make the same short URL work whether it has a trailing slash or not. (This feature has to be explicitly enabled via [installation tool](/documentation/command-line-interface/installation-tool) or [environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables)).

This means that, while the feature is enabled, if you create the short URL `https://examp.le/foo` and a user ends up visiting `https://examp.le/foo/`, the visit will be properly captured and the user will be redirected.

In older versions of Shlink or when this is not enabled, visiting a short URL with trailing slash results in a 404.

If you want to support trailing slashes in any route known by Shlink and not only short URLs, you can configure the web server in front of Shlink to strip trailing slashes before calling it:

* Nginx: https://ubiq.co/tech-blog/remove-trailing-slash-in-nginx/
* Apache: https://ubiq.co/tech-blog/how-to-remove-trailing-slash-in-apache/
* Caddy: https://caddy.community/t/efficient-remove-trailing-slash-redirect/3289

### QR codes

Shlink comes with built-in support to generate QR codes for any short URL.

Getting a QR code URL is as simple as appending `/qr-code` to any short URL. So if your short URL is `https://exam.ple/abc123`, the URL which returns the binary QR code image is `https://exam.ple/abc123/qr-code`.

The image supports certain level of customization via query params:

* `size`: It determines the width/height in pixels. Default value is 300 and accepts values from 50 to 1000.
* `margin` *(since v2.6.0)* : The space in pixels between the QR code itself and the border of the image. Default value is 0 and accepts positive numbers.
* `format` *(since v2.4.0)* : Can be `png` or `svg`. Default values is `png`.
* `errorCorrection` *(since v2.8.0)* : Can be `L` (Low), `M` (Medium), `Q` (Quartile) or `H` (High). Default value is `L`. [Learn more](https://www.qrcode.com/en/about/error_correction.html).
* `roundBlockSize` *(since v2.10.0)* : Can be `true` or `false`. Tells if the block size should be rounded, making the QR code more readable, but potentially adding some extra margin as a side effect.

For example `https://exam.ple/abc123/qr-code?size=500&format=svg&margin=20&errorCorrection=Q&roundBlockSize=false`.

See the ["endpoint" docs](https://api-spec.shlink.io/#/URL%20Shortener/shortUrlQrCode) for more information.

> Take into consideration that the total size of the image will be determined by the size + the margin times two. So, if the size is 500 and the margin is 20, the resulting image will be 540x540 pixels.

<Callout type="info">
  Starting with Shlink 2.9.0, you can customize the default configuration for QR codes via <Link href="/documentation/command-line-interface/installation-tool">installation tool</Link> or <Link href="/documentation/environment-variables#qr-codes">env vars</Link>.
</Callout>

### Bot detection

Starting with v2.7.0, Shlink can now detect visits from potential bots or crawlers, based on the visitor's `User-Agent` header.

Of course, there's never a 100% accuracy here, hence the **potential**.

All the endpoints serving visits will include the `potentialBot` flag with values `true` or `false`, and they also allow excluding potential bots from the result set.

### Email tracking

Shlink can track how many times an email has been opened, by taking advantage of its URL tracking capabilities.

You can track emails with any existing short URL, or create a new one pointing to a dummy long URL (the redirect itself is not important for this use case).

Then, by appending `/track` to the short URL, you will have a new URL (for example, `https://example.com/abc123/track`) that resolves to a 1px transparent image. Add it to any email you want to track.

The image is effectively invisible, but every time the email is opened and the image is loaded, Shlink will count one visit.
