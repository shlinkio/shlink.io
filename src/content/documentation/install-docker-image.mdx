## Install using a docker image

The docker image is probably the simplest installation use case, since it includes all dependencies and makes use of [openswoole](https://openswoole.com/) to serve Shlink.

### Usage

The most basic way to run Shlink's docker image is by providing these mandatory env vars.

* `DEFAULT_DOMAIN`: The custom short domain used for this Shlink instance. For example **doma.in**.
* `IS_HTTPS_ENABLED`: Either **true** or **false**.
* `GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY`: Your GeoLite2 license key. [Learn more](/documentation/geolite-license-key/) about this.

To run Shlink on top of a local docker service, and using an internal SQLite database, do the following:

```bash
docker run \
    --name my_shlink \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -e DEFAULT_DOMAIN=doma.in \
    -e IS_HTTPS_ENABLED=true \
    -e GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY=kjh23ljkbndskj345 \
    shlinkio/shlink:stable
```

##### Interact with Shlink's CLI on a running container.

Once the Shlink container is running, you can interact with the [CLI entry point](/documentation/command-line-interface/entry-point) by running `shlink` with any of the supported commands.

For example, if the container is called `my_shlink`, you can generate a new API key with:

```bash
docker exec -it my_shlink shlink api-key:generate
```

Or you can list all tags with:

```bash
docker exec -it my_shlink shlink tag:list
```

Or locate remaining visits with:

```bash
docker exec -it my_shlink shlink visit:locate
```

All Shlink commands will work the same way.

You can also list all available commands just by running this:

```bash
docker exec -it my_shlink shlink
```

### Use an external DB

The image comes with a working SQLite database, but in production, it's strongly recommended using a distributed database.

It is possible to use a set of env vars to make this Shlink instance interact with an external MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server database.

* `DB_DRIVER`: **[Mandatory]**. Use the value **mysql**, **maria**, **postgres** or **mssql** to prevent the SQLite database to be used.
* `DB_NAME`: [Optional]. The database name to be used. Defaults to **shlink**.
* `DB_USER`: **[Mandatory]**. The username credential for the database server.
* `DB_PASSWORD`: **[Mandatory]**. The password credential for the database server.
* `DB_HOST`: **[Mandatory]**. The host name of the server running the database engine.
* `DB_PORT`: [Optional]. The port in which the database service is running.
    * Default value is based on the value provided for `DB_DRIVER`:
        * **mysql** or **maria** -> `3306`
        * **postgres** -> `5432`
        * **mssql** -> `1433`

> PostgreSQL is supported since v1.16.1 and Microsoft SQL server since v2.1.0. Do not try to use them with previous versions.

Taking this into account, you could run Shlink on a local docker service like this:

```bash
docker run \
    --name my_shlink \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -e DEFAULT_DOMAIN=doma.in \
    -e IS_HTTPS_ENABLED=true \
    -e GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY=kjh23ljkbndskj345 \
    -e DB_DRIVER=mysql \
    -e DB_USER=root \
    -e DB_PASSWORD=123abc \
    -e DB_HOST=something.rds.amazonaws.com \
    shlinkio/shlink:stable
```

You could even link to a local database running on a different container:

```bash
docker run \
    --name my_shlink \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    [...] \
    -e DB_HOST=some_mysql_container \
    --link some_mysql_container \
    shlinkio/shlink:stable
```

> If you have considered using SQLite but sharing the database file with a volume, read [this issue](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-docker-image/issues/40) first.

### Other integrations

#### Use an external redis server

If you plan to run more than one Shlink instance, there are some resources that should be shared ([Multi instance considerations](/documentation/install-docker-image#multi-instance-considerations)).

One of those resources are the locks Shlink generates to prevent some operations to be run more than once in parallel (in the future, these redis servers could be used for other caching operations).

In order to share those locks, you should use an external redis server (redis cluster and redis sentinels are also supported), by providing the `REDIS_SERVERS` env var, and optionally, the `REDIS_SENTINEL_SERVICE` if you are using sentinels.

It can be either one server name or a comma-separated list of servers.

> If more than one redis server is provided, Shlink will expect them to be configured as a [redis cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial), unless `REDIS_SENTINEL_SERVICE` has also been provided.

#### Integrate with a mercure hub server

One way to get real time updates when certain events happen in Shlink is by integrating it with a [mercure hub](https://mercure.rocks/) server.

If you do that, Shlink will publish updates and other clients can subscribe to those.

There are three env vars you need to provide if you want to enable this:

* `MERCURE_PUBLIC_HUB_URL`: **[Mandatory]**. The public URL of a mercure hub server to which Shlink will sent updates. This URL will also be served to consumers that want to subscribe to those updates.
* `MERCURE_INTERNAL_HUB_URL`: **[Optional]**. An internal URL for a mercure hub. Will be used only when publishing updates to mercure, and does not need to be public. If this is not provided, the `MERCURE_PUBLIC_HUB_URL` one will be used to publish updates.
* `MERCURE_JWT_SECRET`: **[Mandatory]**. The secret key that was provided to the mercure hub server, in order to be able to generate valid JWTs for publishing/subscribing to that server.

So in order to run Shlink with mercure integration, you would do it like this:

```bash
docker run \
    --name my_shlink \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -e DEFAULT_DOMAIN=doma.in \
    -e IS_HTTPS_ENABLED=true \
    -e GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY=kjh23ljkbndskj345 \
    -e "MERCURE_PUBLIC_HUB_URL=https://example.com"
    -e "MERCURE_INTERNAL_HUB_URL=http://my-mercure-hub.prod.svc.cluster.local"
    -e MERCURE_JWT_SECRET=super_secret_key
    shlinkio/shlink:stable
```

> The integration with mercure is available since Shlink **v2.2.0**. More information can be found [here](/documentation/advanced/real-time-updates#mercure-hub-server).

### Supported env vars

A few env vars have been already used in previous examples, but this image supports others that can be used to customize its behavior.

See the full list of supported [Environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables).

### Multi-architecture

Starting on v2.3.0, Shlink's docker image is built for multiple architectures.

The only limitation is that images for architectures other than `amd64` will not have support for Microsoft SQL databases, since there are no official binaries.

### Multi-instance considerations

These are some considerations to take into account when running multiple Shlink instances.

* Some operations performed by Shlink should never be run more than once at the same time (like creating the database for the first time, or downloading the GeoLite2 database). For this reason, Shlink uses a locking system.

    However, these locks are locally scoped to each Shlink instance by default.

    You can (and should) make the locks to be shared by all Shlink instances by using a redis server/cluster. Just define the `REDIS_SERVERS` env var with the list of servers.

### Versions

Versioning on this docker image works as follows:

* `X.X.X`:  when providing a specific version number, the image version will match the Shlink version it contains. For example, installing `shlinkio/shlink:2.9.1`, you will get an image containing Shlink v2.9.1.
* `stable`: always holds the latest stable tag. For example, if latest Shlink version is 3.0.0, installing `shlinkio/shlink:stable`, you will get an image containing shlink v3.0.0
* `latest`: always holds the latest contents, and it's considered unstable and not suitable for production.
