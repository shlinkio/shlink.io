## Install using a dist file

If you are going to host Shlink yourself, you need to make sure your server fulfils its requirements:

* PHP 8.3, 8.4 or 8.5
* The next PHP extensions: json, curl, pdo, intl, gd and gmp/bcmath.
    * apcu extension is recommended if you don't plan to use RoadRunner.
    * ~xml extension is required if you want to generate QR codes in svg format.~ (QR code generation is deprecated, see [this issue](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/2408) for details).
    * sockets and bcmath extensions are required if you want to integrate with a RabbitMQ instance, or use [RoadRunner to serve Shlink](/documentation/supported-runtimes/serve-with-roadrunner/).
* MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MicrosoftSQL or SQLite.
    * You will also need the corresponding pdo variation for the database you are planning to use: `pdo_mysql`, `pdo_pgsql` or `pdo_sqlsrv`.
* One of the [supported runtimes](/documentation/supported-runtimes/).

### Installation steps

* Download the latest distributable file and decompress it at the location of your choice (you will find a dist file for every supported PHP version).
  <div className="mt-2 mb-1">
    <DownloadLatestBtn />
  </div>
* Create an empty database (not necessary if you are going to use SQLite).
* Recursively grant write permissions to the `data` directory.
* Set-up and customize Shlink by either:
  * Running the [installation tool](/documentation/command-line-interface/installation-tool) (`vendor/bin/shlink-installer install`). It's an interactive tool that will guide you through the installation process.
  * Providing your configuration via [env vars](/documentation/environment-variables) (since v2.9.0). Useful to pre-define the configuration or if you don't have shell access to the server.
* Optionally, you can create a symlink to the `bin/cli` script in a folder which is in your path.<br />For example `/usr/local/bin` for linux systems. This will allow you to easily run Shlink from anywhere in the command line.
* Generate your first API key (you will need it in order to interact with Shlink's API):
  * For Shlink older than 3.3.0, run `bin/cli api-key:generate`.
  * For Shlink 3.3.0 or newer, the installation tool will create an API key for you. Just copy-paste it.
* Set-up Shlink's runtime:
  * [Serve Shlink using RoadRunner](/documentation/supported-runtimes/serve-with-roadrunner/).
  * [Serve Shlink with a classic web server](/documentation/supported-runtimes/classic-web-server/).
* Finally, access to [https://app.shlink.io](https://app.shlink.io) and configure your server to start creating short URLs.
